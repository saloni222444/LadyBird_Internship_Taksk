# 🌟 Everyday with Isa – HTML Blog Page

This project is a simple static HTML page that simulates a blog post titled **"An Insider's Guide to NYFW"**. It was created as part of my learning journey in HTML.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🧱 HTML Structure
- Used the basic HTML5 structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Added a `<title>` inside the `<head>` section.

### 🖼️ Images and Links
- Displayed images using the `<img>` tag and learned how to provide a `src` (source URL).
- Created hyperlinks using `<a>` tag.
  - Used internal navigation (e.g., `href="#contact"`).
  - Used external links that open in a new tab using `target="_blank"`.

### 📑 Content Formatting
- Applied different levels of headings using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>`.
- Wrote descriptive content inside `<p>` tags.
- Used `<strong>` tag to make text bold and emphasize contact info.

### 📋 Lists
- Created an unordered list using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags to showcase related blog topics.

### 📍 Internal Navigation
- Used the `id` attribute to allow anchor linking to the contact section.

## 🛠️ Improvements to Remember
- Avoid curly quotes like “ ” and `"` — always use straight quotes `"` in HTML for proper attribute handling.
- Add `alt` attributes to images for better accessibility.

## 📞 Contact Section
At the bottom of the page, a `div` with the `id="contact"` contains:
- Email
- Phone number
- Address
