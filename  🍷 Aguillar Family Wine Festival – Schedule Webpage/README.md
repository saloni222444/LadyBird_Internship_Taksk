# 🍷 Aguillar Family Wine Festival – Schedule Webpage

This project is a static HTML webpage that displays a beautifully structured **event schedule** for the Annual Aguillar Family Wine Festival. It uses semantic HTML elements and external stylesheets for better layout and readability.

## ✅ Concepts Learned

### 1. HTML Boilerplate Structure
- Used `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` to define the structure of the page.
- Included `<meta charset="utf-8">` to support special characters and symbols.

### 2. Linking External Stylesheets & Fonts
- Linked two external CSS files: `reset.css` and `style.css`.
- Imported Google Font `Oswald` for custom text styling:
  ```html
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald" rel="stylesheet">
  ```

### 3. Semantic Elements
- `<header>` and `<footer>` used for page header and footer content.
- `<div class="container">` used to wrap the main content section.

### 4. Tables in HTML
- Used `<table>` to present the event schedule.
- `<thead>`, `<tbody>` used to define table structure.
- `<th colspan="3">` demonstrates merging cells for a full-width heading.
- `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` used to create rows and data cells.

### 5. Use of Headings Inside Table
- Nested headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) used within table cells for visual emphasis and readability.

### 6. Special Characters
- Used HTML entities like `&amp;` for special characters (e.g., `Wine & Cheese Tasting`).
