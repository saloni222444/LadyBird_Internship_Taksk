## ✅ Concepts Learned

### 1. Basic HTML Structure
- Use of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to create the overall structure of a webpage.

### 2. Headings
- Usage of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` tags to define headings and subheadings for clear content hierarchy.

### 3. Paragraphs and Line Breaks
- `<p>` tag used for paragraph text.
- `<br />` tag used for adding line breaks within paragraphs.

### 4. Text Formatting
- `<em>`: Emphasizes text (usually displayed in *italics*).
- `<strong>`: Makes text bold to show importance.

### 5. Lists
- `<ul>`: Unordered list for items without a sequence (like species).
- `<ol>`: Ordered list for items in a specific order (like countries).
- `<li>`: List items inside both `<ul>` and `<ol>`.

### 6. Divisions and Sectioning
- `<div>` tags used to separate the page into different content sections (`#introduction`, `#habitat`, `#media`).

### 7. Media Embedding
- `<img>` tag to display an image with `src` and `alt` attributes.
- `<video>` tag to embed a video with `controls`, `width`, and `height`.

### 8. HTML Attributes
- `id`: Used to uniquely identify elements for styling or scripting.
- `src`, `alt`, `controls`, `width`, `height` used to provide functionality and accessibility to media content.
