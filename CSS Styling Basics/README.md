## ✅ What I Learned

### 🎨 Typography
- **font-family**: Specifies the typeface (e.g., Arial, Verdana) used for text.
- **font-size**: Controls the size of the text.
- **font-weight**: Determines the thickness of text (like normal, bold, etc.).

### 🧭 Text Alignment
- **text-align**: Aligns text inside a container. Options include:
  - `left`
  - `right`
  - `center`

### 🌈 Color Styling
- **color**: Defines the color of the text.
- **background-color**: Sets the background color behind the text or element.

### ✨ Transparency & Images
- **opacity**: Controls how transparent or visible an element is.
- **background-image**: Sets an image as the background of an element.

### ⚠️ Special Note
- **!important**: Forces a CSS rule to override all others, no matter where it's placed.
  > 🔴 It should be used sparingly, as it can make stylesheets hard to manage or debug.
