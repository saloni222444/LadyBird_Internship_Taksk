## ✅ Concepts Learned

### 1. HTML Document Structure
- Use of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to structure the webpage correctly.

### 2. Linking External Resources
- `<link>` tag used to:
  - Import **Google Fonts** for typography customization.
  - Connect an external **CSS file** (`style.css`) to style the page.

### 3. Navigation Bar with `<ul>` and `<li>`
- Created a top navigation menu using an unordered list.
- Added an image logo inside the navbar using `<img>`.
- Used class `"active"` to highlight the current page.

### 4. Tables in HTML
- Used `<table>` to display company shipping data in a structured way.
- `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` used to divide table into header, body, and footer sections.
- `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` used to define rows, data cells, and header cells.

### 5. Text Content and Layout
- Used a `<div>` for the "Search the table" section (can be styled or made functional later).
- Structured the data clearly with visual separation of sections.
